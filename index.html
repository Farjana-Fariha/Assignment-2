                        <p>Copa América, (Spanish: America Cup) formerly (until 1975) South American Championship of Nations, quadrennial South American football (soccer) tournament that is the continent’s premier competition in that sport. The Copa América is the world’s oldest international football tournament.</p>
                        <p>The event was first held in 1916 in honour of the 100th anniversary of Argentina’s independence—with Uruguay winning the inaugural title. It took place every one to four years before it adopted its current quadrennial format in 2007. The Copa América is governed by the Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol (commonly known as CONMEBOL), and the tournament’s field consists of the 10 national teams that are members of CONMEBOL—Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela—plus two additional national teams that are invited to participate in the event.</p>
